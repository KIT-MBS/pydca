Python implementation of meanfield Direct Coupling Analysis 
for proteins and RNAs.

1. Installation.
==================
To install this package, make sure that you have python installed,
preferrably python 3.5 or latter. 

2. Testing
============
To run tests, run from the command line: 
python setup.py test. 

3. Installation
==================
To install the the package, run the following commands

python setup.py bdist_wheel 

python setup.py install 

4. Running DCA computations
==========================

Once installation is sucessfully done, the command mfdca can be
used to run DCA computations. Below are a few examples.

Exmaples:

To find help information run

mfdca --help

This should output basic information about how to use the package. 
However, to see help about a specific command run

mfdca the_command --help

where the_command can be any of compute_di, compute_couplings, compute_fi, 
or compute_fij

To compute DCA scores for a particular alignment data run

mfdca compute_di  MSA_file biomolecule 

where MSA_file is the FASTA file containing alignment data,
biomolecule referes to the sequence type. It must be either
protein or RNA in upper or lower case letters.

In this case the output data is saved in a directory 
in your current directory. The name of this directory 
will be the base name of the FASTA file with a prefix 
or sufix added to it. You can alse specify the name of the 
directory to which output data can be written. For example,

mfdca compute_di MSA_file biomolecule --output_dir myDCA_output_dir

The optional argument --output_dir specifies the output directory.
If the directory does not exist a new one will be created (assuming 
the user has a previlege to do so). 

When computation is carried out, only messages about warnning and error are 
printed on the terminal by default. It is also possible to see 
the basic information about computation steps using --verbose 
option. For examples

mfdca compute_di MSA_file biomolecule --verbose


Often, one is interested on the DCA score of a particular reference 
sequence. In this situation, a FASTA file containing a reference sequence
should be passed on the command line. Example:

mfdca compute_di MSA_file biomolecule --ref_seq_file refseq_FASTA_file


Sometime an error can be raised when there are non-standared residues
in the alignment FASTA file. You can force the computation to proceed
as follows

mfdca compute_di MSA_file biomolecule --force_seq_type

Note that if you supply an MSA file containing RNA sequences and the biomolecule
is specified to be protein or vice versa, forcing the computation to proceed results in 
wrong data output.
